/**
 * Refuse an output destination that would write somewhere the caller did not
 * name, or over something the caller is reading.
 *
 * Three distinct holes, and each needs its own check because no one of them
 * catches the others:
 *
 * 1. A SYMLINK AT THE DESTINATION writes wherever the link points, which may be
 *    anywhere on the machine. `realpath` on the destination does not help --
 *    it resolves the link, and resolving is precisely the dangerous act. The
 *    link is refused on sight, by `lstat`, before anything is opened. A link
 *    whose target does not exist yet is refused for the same reason: following
 *    it creates a file outside the tree the caller named.
 * 2. A SYMLINKED PARENT does the same thing one level up, so the parent is
 *    resolved and checked against the root rather than compared lexically.
 *    Lexical comparison passes for `root/link/out` where `link` leaves the root.
 * 3. A HARD LINK TO AN INPUT has no target to resolve and shares no path with
 *    it, so realpath and string comparison both say it is a different file. It
 *    is the same file. Only device plus inode sees that.
 *
 * Measured across this catalog: ten tools accepted a destination that destroyed
 * a file they were never asked to touch, and four of them exited 0 reporting
 * success. Knowing about a hole does not close it; a test that fails when the
 * guard is removed closes it.
